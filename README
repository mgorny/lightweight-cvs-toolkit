Lightweight CVS toolkit
-- to make CVS less annoying when you love git


lcvs-init
	A trivial tool to create lightweight CVS checkout. Unlike full CVS
	checkout, it's going to hold only whatever you will be working on
	(no full ebuild tree, no profiles, no eclasses...) and it will
	use your master repository (rsync or git) to find the missing files,
	just like a regular overlay.

	More details on the wiki:
	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Lightweight_CVS_Checkout

lcvs-merge-pr
	Try to merge Pull Request into CVS. Fetches the diff for it,
	cvs up-s the necessary directories, git-applies the patch on top
	of it and calls cvs add/cvs rm as appropriate. You still need to
	update the ChangeLogs and commit the ebuilds yourself though.

lcvs-revert
	Try to revert a commit using git commit hash. Once again, fetches
	the diff, cvs up-s and git-reverse-applies the patch. You are
	responsible for updating the ChangeLog and committing the relevant
	bits.

lcvs-cleanup
	Clean up local changes to the lightweight CVS checkout, using git.
